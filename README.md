# LF-MRI_MS
This repository contains code related to Portable, _Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sensitively Detects and Accurately Quantifies Multiple Sclerosis Lesions_. It contains two files:
- **manuscript_companion.ipynb**
- **ICC_R_irr.R**

The main file is **manuscript_companion.ipynb**, which is a jupyter notebook containing _python_ code related to the study. This jupyter notebook was designed as a companion to the publication's results section. We hope it increases study transparency and allows researchers to reuse relevant code in their own studies. The notebook contains each paragraph from the results section, followed by the code used to derive that section's results. The notebook contains all statistical analyses included in the study. Images containing figure components are presented in the order they appear in the publication. Notebook images are often only a component of a more complex figure in the publication and not all publication figures appear in this companion. We also included **ICC_R_irr.R**, which contains intraclass correlation analyses performed in the _R_ programming language using the irr package.

Additional information about the code and related article links will added after publication.
